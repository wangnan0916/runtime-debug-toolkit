# Trace Mode

This workflow adds temporary logs, analyzes one runtime trace, and locates the responsible code boundary.
It reports evidence without changing product behavior.
The bundled scripts require Node.js 24 or later.

Run this trace loop:

```text
analyze code -> plan events -> arm server -> instrument -> trigger -> analyze logs -> locate code -> clean
```

## 1. Frame the Trace

Start from the user's runtime question or observed behavior.
Read relevant entry points, handlers, state transitions, and existing logs.
Write a Trace Card:

- Runtime question
- Trigger, route, command, input, or fixture
- Candidate code path
- Unknown boundary or state transition
- Observable answer

Record unavailable facts as `unknown`.
Resolve consequential unknowns through code reading or targeted events.

**Complete when:** one candidate path reaches the unknown boundary, and the trace has one observable answer.

## 2. Plan the Events

Read [`references/probes.md`](references/probes.md) before editing instrumentation.
Plan two to eight low-volume events around the disputed boundary.
Each event must distinguish a path, transition, or relevant value.

**Complete when:** every unknown has a named event and an expected record condition.

## 3. Arm the Server

Read [`references/collector.md`](references/collector.md) before running a server command.
Select its startup permission path from the execution environment's declared sandbox limits.
Use the safe wrapper unless the user supplied a complete healthy server contract.
Capture every printed value.

**Complete when:** `LOG_SERVER_URL`, `SESSION_ID`, `LOG_DIR`, `LOG_FILE`, and `HEALTH_URL` are known.

## 4. Instrument the Path

Add the planned events using the generic helpers or an equivalent runtime client.
Wrap every helper and event in the required session markers.
Inspect every payload field against the privacy allowlist.
Keep runtime standard output unchanged.

**Complete when:** every planned event is marked, session-correct, low-volume, and privacy-reviewed.

## 5. Capture One Trace

Run the trigger directly when it is safe and available.
Otherwise read [`references/checkpoint.md`](references/checkpoint.md) and select the checkpoint path from tool availability alone:
when `request_user_input` is listed, you MUST call it; otherwise call the Pi chooser when listed;
use the exact plain-text template only after neither interactive path can run.
The native tool call is the checkpoint; commentary or a final answer cannot replace it.
Present one fresh checkpoint for the attempt and wait. A native cancellation leaves it pending.

**Complete when:** the current session contains a trace for the stated trigger.

## 6. Analyze and Locate

Read the current session records from `LOG_FILE`.
Confirm that every planned probe is present, then inspect the records in file order and compare the relevant values.
Return to Step 2 when expected events are missing.

Write the location report:

```text
Question: <runtime question>
Location: <file, function, and boundary>
Evidence: <ordered events and relevant values>
Confidence: <high, medium, or low with reason>
Next step: <smallest useful follow-up>
```

**Complete when:** current-session evidence answers the question and identifies the responsible code boundary.

## 7. Clean or Hand Off

For a standalone trace, remove every `LOG_SERVER_PROBE <session_id>` region.
Search for the marker, session ID, and both region forms.
Delete `LOG_FILE` unless the user requests retained evidence.
Keep the shared server running unless the user requests shutdown.

When another workflow called this skill, hand back the active probes and evidence.
The caller then owns later edits, verification, and cleanup.

**Complete when:** standalone traces leave no instrumentation, or the caller receives an explicit active-trace handoff.

## Failure Branch

Read [`references/troubleshooting.md`](references/troubleshooting.md) only after startup, capture, or delivery fails.
